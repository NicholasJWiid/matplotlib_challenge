**Pymaceuticals Analysis** <br>
Pymaceuticals, Inc. has began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. The company's most recent study identified 249 mice with SCC tumors and administered treatment with a range of drug regimens. Tumor development was observed and measured over the course of 45 days. The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. The aim of this analysis is to clean, format and analyse the full dataset from the clinical study, and generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report. A top-level summary of the study results is also provided.
